# Board-Design-Files
This is the repository for the Neuron and Neuron-Z1 from BrainBoardz. The Neuron and Nueron-Z1 are ESP32-S2 based modules that support Arduino and Circuit Python. 

If you would like to learn more about BrainBoardz our website is http://www.brainboardz.com

You are welcome to design your own Neuron or BrainBoardz board. We do not allow 3rd party boards to use our name or logo, but you are welcome to indicate "BrainBoardz Compatible" on your board if it is 100% compatible and it is manufactured using a Lead Free process.  Please ensure that you follow our design guidelines very closely. The pin assignments have to be 100% compatible and the connector placement is extremely critical.  Also, please ensure that Neurons run properly (including the SD-card, Blinky and the Piezo) on your design.  If you design a really  interesting board we would love to see it!
